The main difference between OFD.. etc and the traditional locks is because the
ofd locks are associated with descriptors and not processes, they work with
threads.

Solution:

    If someone opens an OFD lock, replace read(), write() with code that does GETLK?

It will be slow, but work?

Could also use flock() system call instead?

What system calls check flocks?
